Architecture and Terminology of IoT

-	Internet

The Internet is the biggest world-wide communication network of computers. The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry many different kinds of information. The short form of internet is the 'net'. The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world.

-	Server

A server is a computer connected to a network of other workstations called 'clients'. Client computers request information from the server over the network. Servers tend to have more storage, memory and processing power than a normal workstation. How a server functions depends on the type of network it is on
-	Cloud computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and more- over the internet (”the cloud”).

-	Edge computing

Edge computing is a form of computing that is done on site or near a particular data source, minimizing the need for data to be processed in a remote data center.

-	Fog computing

Fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure or process in which computing resources are located between the data source and the cloud or any other data center.

-	Swarm

Swarm intelligence (SI) is in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and is based on the collective behavior of elements in decentralized and self-organized systems. SI has a great involvement in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) and IoT-based systems in order to logically control their operations

-	Things

Intelligent things is a term for everyday objects that incorporate autonomous technology. In other words, intelligent things can respond to real world conditions automatically.

-	Gateway

A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet.

-	Nodes

A node is a point of intersection/connection within a data communication network. In an environment where all devices are accessible through the network, these devices are all considered nodes. The individual definition of each node depends on the type of network it refers to.
