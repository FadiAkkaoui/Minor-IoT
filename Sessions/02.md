Architecture and Terminology of IoT

-	Internet

The Internet is the biggest world-wide communication network of computers. The Internet has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which together carry many different kinds of information. The short form of internet is the 'net'. The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by billions of people all over the world. Internet is everything.

-	Server

A server is a computer connected to a network of other workstations called 'clients'. Client computers request information from the server over the network. Servers tend to have more storage, memory and processing power than a normal workstation. How a server functions depends on the type of network it is on.

-	Cloud computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services – servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and more- over the internet (”the cloud”). 

Reference: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/

-	Edge computing

Edge computing is a form of computing that is done on site or near a particular data source, minimizing the need for data to be processed in a remote data center.

-	Fog computing

Fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure or process in which computing resources are located between the data source and the cloud or any other data center.

-	Swarm

Swarm intelligence (SI) is in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and is based on the collective behavior of elements in decentralized and self-organized systems. SI has a great involvement in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) and IoT-based systems in order to logically control their operations. Swarm can work without the internet.

-	Things

Intelligent things is a term for everyday objects that incorporate autonomous technology. In other words, intelligent things can respond to real world conditions automatically. Are the sensors that we connect to the micro controllers.

-	Gateway

A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet.

-	Nodes

A node is a point of intersection/connection within a data communication network. In an environment where all devices are accessible through the network, these devices are all considered nodes. The individual definition of each node depends on the type of network it refers to. Ever compuputer is a node that uses IP. f

Gateway setup (what went wrong, what network architecture did you chose) & Disable secure boot

We had to restart the computer and press "F12" that would take us to the BIOS, using the USB with the LINUx of course. There we had to enable "secure boot", that did not work due to limited permission from the school, IT-department had to come and give us access, they did that, but still did not work to setup an accesspoint. The problem was that if you plugin ethernet, they automatically turn off wifi, which makes it hard to use a dell both on ethernet and wifi (or as a wifi gateway), we had to turn that off in the BIOS so we could use the accesspoint. 

Node-Red and dashboard installation (and small test)

IoTempower installation (show welcome message as proof)

The installation was pretty easy, we had to setup our usernames and passwords etc. When finised intallation we got the welcome message which you can see down below.

Story IoT

Fadi and Maltie

Choose one of three:
You build home gateways (basically you want to create a company like Loxone) 
You build a middle school emergency remote for schools against robberies
You have to record current wind and temperature data all over Austria to allow decisions for wind farms management

We chose: You build a middle school emergency remote for schools against robberies

The story:
The robber: Rob, Student: Philip.
Philip is a 15 year old student who lives in Detroit with his mom and dad. He has been saving money for four years now and now has 500 dollars. Recently, the new iPhone 13 got released. All the cool kids at school already have it. Philip wants to feel cool too. This new iPhone costs 1000 dollars, so he can not afford it. He goes home very sad and his mom asks him why. He tells his mom that he can not afford the new phone and he does not feel cool. After the story she lets her son borrow 500 dollars to get the new iPhone 13. Philip goes to buy the phone at the Apple store and goes straight home after. 

His mom gets a package from school with a letter about robberies. There are a lot of robberies on the school lately. The package contains an emergency button which is specifically made for the school Philip goes to. This emergency button is small and has a hook so you can attach it easily to your belt. The button is also very noticeable because of the big red button on the middle. When pressed once, the button makes a loud noise and sends a message to the security of the school. When pressed twice, the button does not make any sound and sends a message to the security. The message contains the following: ‘I am in danger and I am at this location..’ The emergency button works via a server address that is pre-installed in the device and this communicates with the server that is on the school. When pressed, the security gets a message on the computer with an alert. The alert rings three times, then the message appears with the location of the emergency.

When he gets home his mom warns Philip about robberies and she gives him the emergency button. If Philip looses his phone, he can not get a new one. Next day he goes to his school very happy, with his new phone and the button. Rob goes to the same school as Philip but he goes to a class higher than Philip. Rob is very poor and wants to earn some extra money. He is planning to steal a couple of phones to sell them to a pawn shop. The first person he sees with a good phone is Philip. Philip is walking to class through the corridor. Philip sees Rob coming towards him very fast and presses his emergency button immediately. The button makes a loud noise and sends a signal to the security. Rob gets scared and runs away. Pressing the button was very easy for Philip. After a while the security arrives at the location. Because there was a witness they could find Rob very easily. Rob gets detention and Philip can enjoy his new phone a bit longer. The device saved Philip.

Stable WiFi solution (either computer as gateway integration or stand-alone gateway/accesspoint) - repeat session 1 hw task with this setup

The first step was to set up an access point through the dell computer (computer as a gateway integration) to be able to connect all components to a wifi to be able to control them. There were no strange things except that I forgot my password, but Ulno helped me. By going to the konsole, writing "iot" and then writing "accesspoint" we got the wifi. 

Button & Integration (switch led via button on other MCU)

The second step was to configure an MCU component, via the arduino IDE. Select the correct port for USB output, the correct board (LOLIN D1 R2 & mini), use the pre-installed flash code. In the code itself, it is important to change the correct internet that the computer uses with the same name and password for it to work. After that "Verify" and then "Upload". Everything is okay, so I open "Serial Monitor", where I get the IP address that I copy and paste on the browser, where I could turn on the LED light and turn it off. I used the default code that comes with the arduino IDE.

After completing the configuration with the first MCU component, I connected it to my personal computer and connected the MCU button to the dell computer, Here I had to do the same thing as the first with all configurations using Ulno which show me the steps. When I got to the coding I had difficulties as I did not understand the logic of the coding, Ulno helped me with the coding where we created two functions a "sendon" and a "sendoff", in these codes I had to paste the IP address one with / on and with / off. Here it is also important to set up the right internet connection. I got it started, where if I press the button, the MCU component connected to my Macbook flashes and if I release it, it goes out.

Buses systems prep (HW unboxing)
Low Level Busses
Button (shield or breadboard), read-up on pullup

Second Led (on breadboard) & Second Button (on breadboard)

The task here was to enable another button on the breadboard to switch the the led light that also was in the breadboard. I asked for help to get thi task done. Ulno help me with the new setup and coding. The first thing we did was to connect the new MCU trough the USB in to the laptop. I was on my own at the beggining trying to solve it, I copied the two functions "sendon" and "sendoff" and dublicated it, the problem was that I was working on the wrong code, that was Ulno who noticed it. He told me we sould work on the "HelloServerled" that I created instead of "New.button.2". There we did the same thing copied the yellow marked code that is illustraited on the image and dublicated it. Because we were using "D5" on the MCU we had to define it on the code, instead of "LED_BUILTIN" we wrote "D5" on both. I ran the code afterwords and the LED was lightning up when pressing the button on the breadboard as you can see on the image. 

Resistor is importatant to resist the high voltage from letting the LED lamp not work anymore. 
Red cable is as a "design pattern" for the "+"
Black cable is for the "-".
