Dalas temputure sensor: one wire sensor
LED: one wire protocol
hx711 scale: The HX711 is a precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that is designed for weighing scales and industrial control applications to interface directly with a bridge sensor. It is specially made for amplifying signals from cells and reporting them to another microcontroller.

Oled screen: Speaks I2C
I2C: The I2C protocol involves using two lines to send and receive data: a serial clock pin (SCL) that the Arduino Controller board pulses at a regular interval, and a serial data pin (SDA) over which data is sent between the two devices.

an organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current. basically its display, yeah a display, a very small one. so in this tutorial, I'm gonna be using SSD1306 Oled display and an Arduino Nano. SSD1306 model is a mono-color, 0.96-inch display with 128×64 pixels.

DHT22: The DHT-22 (also named as AM2302) is a digital-output relative humidity and temperature sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin.

RFID-RC522:RFID or Radio Frequency Identification system consists of two main components, a transponder/tag attached to an object to be identified, and a Transceiver also known as interrogator/Reader.A Reader consists of a Radio Frequency module and an antenna which generates high frequency electromagnetic field. On the other hand, the tag is usually a passive device, meaning it doesn’t contain a battery. Instead it contains a microchip that stores and processes information, and an antenna to receive and transmit a signal.

FC-22: Gas SensorFC-22 (MQ2) module is useful for gas leakage detection (in home and industry). It is suitable for detecting H2, LPG, CH4, CO, Alcohol, Smoke or Propane. Due to its high sensitivity and fast response time, measurements can be taken as soon as possible. The sensitivity of the sensor can be adjusted by using the potentiometer.

APDS-9960: Using this module in Arduino you can detect the gesture of your hand either UP, down, Left, Right and do something like controlling servo, motor or some other action.

VL53L0X: This sensor is a carrier/breakout board for ST’s VL53L0X laser-ranging sensor, which measures the range to a target object up to 2 m away. The VL53L0X uses time-of-flight measurements of infrared pulses for ranging, allowing it to give accurate results independent of the target’s color and surface. Distance measurements can be read through a digital I2C interface. The board has a 2.8 V linear regulator and integrated level-shifters that allow it to work over an input voltage range of 2.6 V to 5.5 V, and the 0.1″ pin spacing makes it easy to use with standard solderless breadboards and 0.1″ perfboards.

RCWL-1601: Advertisements. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or 1” to 13 feet.
