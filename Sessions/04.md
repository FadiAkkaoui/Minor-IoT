RFID-RC522: RFID or Radio Frequency Identification system consists of two main components, a transponder/tag attached to an object to be identified, and a Transceiver also known as interrogator/Reader.A Reader consists of a Radio Frequency module and an antenna which generates high frequency electromagnetic field. On the other hand, the tag is usually a passive device, meaning it doesn’t contain a battery. Instead it contains a microchip that stores and processes information, and an antenna to receive and transmit a signal.

VL53L0X: This sensor is a carrier/breakout board for ST’s VL53L0X laser-ranging sensor, which measures the range to a target object up to 2 m away. The VL53L0X uses time-of-flight measurements of infrared pulses for ranging, allowing it to give accurate results independent of the target’s color and surface. Distance measurements can be read through a digital I2C interface. The board has a 2.8 V linear regulator and integrated level-shifters that allow it to work over an input voltage range of 2.6 V to 5.5 V, and the 0.1″ pin spacing makes it easy to use with standard solderless breadboards and 0.1″ perfboards.

Low Level Busses

RS232: The term RS232 stands for "Recommended Standard 232" and it is a type of serial communication used for transmission of data normally in medium distances

https://circuitdigest.com/article/rs232-serial-communication-protocol-basics-specifications 

Wiring: The RMC100 CPU module has a DTE DB9 serial port labeled "RS-232 Monitor." Both RMCWin and the RMCLink ActiveX Control and .NET Assembly Component use this port. Communication over this port is always at 38400 baud with eight (8) data bits, no parity, and one (1) stop bit.

https://deltamotion.com/support/webhelp/rmcwin/Communication_Types/RMC_CPU_RS232_Port/RS_232_Wiring.htm 

Speed of data: 115200 band, 1Mbps

https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/8/83.html 

How long can it be: 50 feet at 19.2kbps

https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/8/83.html

Examples: Modify db9 connects, The RS-232 standard had been commonly used in computer serial ports and is still widely used in industrial communication devices.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232 


RS485: RS-485 is an industrial specification that defines the electrical interface and physical layer for point-to-point communication of electrical devices. The RS-485 standard allows for long cabling distances in electrically noisy environments and can support multiple devices on the same bus.

https://www.cuidevices.com/blog/rs-485-serial-interface-explained 

Wiring & Speed of data and how long can it be:
Ideally an RS485 system consists of a single linear cable (no branches) with 120 ohm resistors connected across the 2 wires at each end of the cable.
RS485 can handle speeds of over 10 Mbits per second and line lengths of over 1 km.
https://www.windmill.co.uk/rs485.html 

Examples: Use is 2x 485 chips used for 422 operations, Some of the examples are robotics, base stations, motor drives, video surveillance and also home appliances. In computer systems, RS485 is used for data transmission between the controller and a disk drive. Commercial aircraft cabins also use RS485 for low-speed data communications. This is due to the minimal wiring required due to the wiring configuration requirements of RS485.

Examples:

SPI: The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. The interface was developed by Motorola in the mid-1980s and has become a de facto standard. Typical applications include Secure Digital cards and liquid crystal displays.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface

Wiring: SPI is a synchronous, full duplex master-slave-based interface. The data from the master or the slave is synchronized on the rising or falling clock edge. Both master and slave can transmit data at the same time. The SPI interface can be either 3-wire or 4-wire.

https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/introduction-to-spi-interface.html#:~:text=SPI%20is%20a%20synchronous%2C%20full,%2Dwire%20or%204%2Dwire.

Speed of data: The SPI bus can run at high speed, transferring data at up to 60 Mbps over short distances like between chips on a board.

https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/isolating-spi-for-high-bandwidth-sensors.html 

How long can it be: While the SPI communication method is generally suitable for distances up to approximately 10 m, to bridge longer distances, a repeater is often needed because of attenuation due to the increased line resistance of long cables.

Onewire: Device communication bus systems, 
1-Wire is a half-duplex bidirectional protocol for microcontrollers and peripherals to communicate with one another. In this guide, learn about the 1-Wire protocol, and obtain temperature readings from the DS18B20 with a Little Bird Uno R3.

https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au/guides/142/1-wire-and-arduino 

Wiring: 2 wires (Ground & data), 1-Wire is a voltage-based digital system that works with two contacts, data and ground, for half- duplex bidirectional communication. Compared to other serial communication systems such as I2C or SPI, 1-Wire devices are designed for use in a momentary contact environment.

https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/tutorials/1/1796.html 

Speed of data: Low speed (16,3 kbit/s)
How long can it be: The maximum total cable length is 100m for 20 sensors. Ring topology is not supported in one wire installations.

https://www.loxone.com/enen/kb/wiring-1-wire-devices/#:~:text=The%20maximum%20total%20cable%20length%20is%20100m%20for%2020%20sensors.&text=Ring%20topology%20is%20not%20supported,then%20no%20signals%20are%20received. 

Examples: Can be used over long distance, Each 1-Wire component contains all of the logic needed to operate on the 1-Wire bus. Examples include temperature loggers, timers, voltage and current sensors, battery monitors, and memory. These can be connected to a PC using a bus converter.

Reflection

- We learnd about the buses system prep, which was interesting, where we got to learn whats in the bluebox. 
- Going through the Low Level Busses, was also interesting to know the speeds, lenght and wiring of some Low Level Buses. 
Going through the exchange formats, This was also an intresting topic were we learnt diffrent kinds of exchange formats, and wich was the most sufficent.
Testing out node-red with buttons, charts , injection etc, This part was new for me, I had a bit hard time learning this and understad the logic. Its getting better. It was nice to get it to work but we did not finish the software part. Next day we worked togheter me, stijn and Johanna and solved it. I got the ide of having a If-statment to see if the input tempurture is below 30 or 10, Stijn made the codeing part and solved that. Johanna looked did build the wildcards for the software part.
