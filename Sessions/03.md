Stable WiFi solution (either computer as gateway integration or stand-alone gateway/accesspoint) - repeat session 1 hw task with this setup

Button (shield or breadboard), read-up (and report) on pullup resistor

Integration (switch led via button on another MCU)

Second Led (on breadboard) connected to first MCU, why do we need a resistor?

Second Button (eventually on breadboard or directly connected),  connected to third MCU

Full integration (2 buttons control 2 different leds)
