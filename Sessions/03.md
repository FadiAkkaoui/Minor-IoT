Stable WiFi solution (either computer as gateway integration or stand-alone gateway/accesspoint) - repeat session 1 hw task with this setup

The first step was to set up an access point through the dell computer (computer as a gateway integration) to be able to connect all components to a wifi to be able to control them. There were no strange things except that I forgot my password, but Ulno helped me. By going to the konsole, writing "iot" and then writing "accesspoint" we got the wifi. 

Button (shield or breadboard), read-up (and report) on pullup resistor & Integration (switch led via button on another MCU)

The second step was to configure an MCU component, via the arduino IDE. Select the correct port for USB output, the correct board (LOLIN D1 R2 & mini), use the pre-installed flash code. In the code itself, it is important to change the correct internet that the computer uses with the same name and password for it to work. After that "Verify" and then "Upload". Everything is okay, so I open "Serial Monitor", where I get the IP address that I copy and paste on the browser, where I could turn on the LED light and turn it off. I used the default code that comes with the arduino IDE.

After completing the configuration with the first MCU component, I connected it to my personal computer and connected the MCU button to the dell computer, Here I had to do the same thing as the first with all configurations using Ulno which show me the steps. When I got to the coding I had difficulties as I did not understand the logic of the coding, Ulno helped me with the coding where we created two functions a "sendon" and a "sendoff", in these codes I had to paste the IP address one with / on and with / off. Here it is also important to set up the right internet connection. I got it started, where if I press the button, the MCU component connected to my Macbook flashes and if I release it, it goes out.

Second Led (on breadboard) connected to first MCU, why do we need a resistor?

Second Button (eventually on breadboard or directly connected),  connected to third MCU & Full integration (2 buttons control 2 different leds)

The task here was to enable another button on the breadboard to switch the the led light that also was in the breadboard. I asked for help to get thi task done. Ulno help me with the new setup and coding. The first thing we did was to connect the new MCU trough the USB in to the laptop. I was on my own at the beggining trying to solve it, I copied the two functions "sendon" and "sendoff" and dublicated it, the problem was that I was working on the wrong code, that was Ulno who noticed it. He told me we sould work on the "HelloServerled" that I created instead of "New.button.2". There we did the same thing copied the yellow marked code that is illustraited on the image and dublicated it. Because we were using "D5" on the MCU we had to define it on the code, instead of "LED_BUILTIN" we wrote "D5" on both. I ran the code afterwords and the LED was lightning up when pressing the button on the breadboard as you can see on the image. 

Resistor is importatant to resist the high voltage from letting the LED lamp not work anymore. 
Red cable is as a "design pattern" for the "+"
Black cable is for the "-". 

Reflection

- Lession 3 was good, and here I gain alot of new knowlege. Like setting up an accesspoint which is something i've never done before. Arduino IDE was also something new for me, as I mentiond I did not understand the logic but got better after practicing a bit. In this class I also understood that what you program to the MCU and upload, the MCU will always run that code when you use the device, which I think is really interesting and cool. Looking forward for the next class.
